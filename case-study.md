## The #1 Crypto Exchange Worldwide's BUSD
BUSD is one of the few stablecoins in the world backed by actual cash. 100% of BUSD's total market cap is backed by cash and cash equivalent reserves.

### Why BUSD?
BUSD is a very popular choice for stablecoin investors not only because it is backed by fiat, it is popular because it is backed by Binance, the highest rated and top earning crypto exchange worldwide. Also, unlike most stablecoins which claim to be compliant with regulator standards, BUSD is actually regulated by NYDFS.

### Current and Future Use Cases of BUSD
BUSD has become one of the fastest growing cryptocurrencies, while offering a wide variety of utilities, from trading and staking, to lending and payments. Because of Binance's massive influence over the Web3 world, it is highly likely that BUSD will be a leading currency for real world transactions once mass adoption takes place.
